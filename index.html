    <p class="webpage">what is web development?
        Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, 
        building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, 
        also include web design, web programming, and database management<br>
       <br>What is a Website?
        A website is a collection of web pages and related contents that are identified by a common domain 
        name and published on at least one webserver, allowing people over the internet to have access to it</br>
       <br> What is a Webpage?
        A webpage is a simple document displayable by a browser. Such documents are written in HTML 
        language and HTML stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE. Basically, a webpage can embed a 
        variety of different types of resources such as:
        a. Styles --- controlling a pages look and feel
        b. Script --- which add interactivity to the page
        c. Media --- images, sounds, and videos.
        d. Links --- linking to another webpage within the same website, linking to a particular section in 
        the same webpage, or linking to an external website
        We come across different kinds of documents almost every day, newspapers, shop catalogue, 
        magazines, etc. Web pages are an electronic version of these documents.</p></br>
